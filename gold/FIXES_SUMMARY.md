# Fixes Applied

## Issue 1: Special Characters ✓ VERIFIED SAFE

**Keywords with special characters** (apostrophes, ampersands, etc.) are preserved exactly as-is throughout the pipeline:

1. ✓ Excel → JSON: Characters preserved
2. ✓ JSON → HTML display: Shows correctly
3. ✓ HTML → Export: JSON keeps exact characters  
4. ✓ Export → analyze_selected.sh: Quoted properly with `"$keyword"`
5. ✓ Shell → appstore CLI: Passed as-is

**Examples found:**
- domino's pizza (apostrophe)
- at&t app (ampersand)
- sam's club (apostrophe)
- o'reilly auto parts (apostrophe)

Total: 101 keywords with special characters

**Test:**
```bash
appstore analyze "domino's pizza"  # Correct - quotes preserve it
```

## Issue 2: HTML Title & Metadata ✓ FIXED

**Before:**
- Title: "Keyword Gold Nuggets"
- Stats: Total Keywords, Country, Generated
- No source file info
- No month info

**After:**
- Title: "Keyword Gold Nuggets"
- Subtitle: "Finding high-popularity, low-competition keywords | Source: [filename]"
- Stats: 
  - Total Keywords: 7500
  - Country: United States
  - **Month: 2025-09** (NEW)
  - Generated: 2025-10-24 19:39

## Total Score Column ✓ ALREADY CORRECT

The table structure already shows Total Score prominently:

| Column # | Header | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| 1 | ☑️ Select | Checkbox |
| 2 | **TOTAL SCORE** | **Sum of 3 scores (green badge)** |
| 3 | KEYWORD | Search term |
| 4 | GENRE | Category |
| 5 | RANK IN GENRE | Position 1-500 |
| 6 | POP. IN GENRE | Popularity 1-100 |
| 7 | POP. OVERALL | Popularity 1-100 |
| 8 | RANK SCORE | Points 0-3 |
| 9 | GENRE SCORE | Points 0-3 |
| 10 | OVERALL SCORE | Points 0-5 |

**Total Score (Column 2):**
- Displays as colored badge (Green ≥8, Yellow 5-7, Red <5)
- Is the sum of columns 8, 9, 10
- Used for default sorting (highest first)
- Range: 0-11 points

**Verification:**
```
tik tok: rank(3) + genre(3) + overall(5) = 11 ✓
```
