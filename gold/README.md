# Looking for gold nuggets in the apps tore

What are gold nuggets?

Keywords that have HIGH popularity but LOW competition.

## How to find gold

First, download the monthly Apple Search Ads Monthly Keyword Rankings report.
An example is in this folder, named:

Month,_Country_or_Region,_Genre,_Search_Term,_Rank_in_Genre,_Search_Popularity_in_Genre_(1-100),_Sea-2.xlsx

We will focus only on United States.

At a high level, there are a few steps:
1. Find keywords that have high search popularity in their genre and overall
2. Do a basic search for each of those keywords and examine the top 20 results for compeitiveness
3. If we have low competitiveness and high popularity, we have struck gold

## Filtering keywords from the monthly rankings report

Each of the keywords from the report will be ranked by us.  To do so, we'll assign points to the most important criteria:

Month	
Country or Region
Genre	
Search Term
Rank in Genre
Search Popularity in Genre (1-100)
Search Popularity (1-100)
Search Popularity

Rank in Genre:
  1 through 10 -- 3 points
  11 through 25 -- 2 points
  26 through 50 -- 1 point

Search popularity in Genre:
  50 through 60 -- 1 point
  61 through 75 -- 2 points
  76 through 100 -- 3 points

Search popularity (overall):
  50 through 60 -- 2 points
  61 through 70 -- 3 points
  71 through 85 -- 4 points
  86 through 100 -- 5 points

We'll add up the points for each and then sort high to low by total points.

## Searching and ranking competitiveness

1. For each search term, we'll run a search or scrape to get the top 20 results
2. For each result, we'll look at these things:
   2a. Are the words of the keyword in question in the app title?
   2b. Are the words of the keyword in question perfectly in-order in the app title, with no other punctuation etc?
   2c. Average star rating * number of ratings
   2d. Number of reviews
   2c. Average age of the app

Average age of the app is based on the app's ORIGINAL release date (of its first version -- not the latest version).
